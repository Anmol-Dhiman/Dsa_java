    // reusing the same code for different types of input or different data types

    // also store the string

    // 2.
    // Generics means parameterized types. The idea is to allow type (Integer,
    // String, â€¦ etc., and user-defined types) to be a parameter to methods,
    // classes, and interfaces. Using Generics, it is possible to create classes
    // that work with different data types. An entity such as class, interface, or
    // method that operates on a parameterized type is a generic entity.

    // when we have to use the same code for different data types then we use the
    // generic
