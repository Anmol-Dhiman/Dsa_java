    // introduction : -

    // here the input is from the outer source i.e. flie cmd, etc

    // reading something : - input stream
    // writing something : - output stream

    // when we read the data mainly from the file or hard disk then we call it input
    // output stream
    // and here stream is the path where the data is traveled in the form of binary
    // from data source to program or from program to the data source

    // there are two type of stream which is
    // characterStream(1. in this stream we read character by character
    // 2. we this when we know that we have to send characters only as the input in
    // the file ) and
    // byteStream (1. we read byte by byte
    // 2. we use when we don't know about the input data type )
